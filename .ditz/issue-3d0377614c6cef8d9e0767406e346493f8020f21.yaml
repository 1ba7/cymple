title: Set up Wiki for project
desc: |-
  I've written a lot of emails and said a lot of stuff in group meetings about the project, but I haven't documented it properly.
  
  I should set up the github wiki properly and write everything down there, encourage other people to add stuff too.
  
  A lot of the initial documentation could be sourced almost directly from emails that I've sent to the list.
