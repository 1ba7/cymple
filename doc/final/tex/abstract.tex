Cymple, a recursive acronym which means `Cymple: Your Musical Past Lovingly Envisioned', is a data visualisation application created using Processing, as outlined by the project specification.\cite{specification} The dataset it visualises consists of entries linking a user, a track and a time to mean `user A listened to track B at time C'. It allows the user to interactively select arbitrary subsets of the given dataset and visualises them appropriately. This report outlines the steps that we took to get from the project specification to the final application.
